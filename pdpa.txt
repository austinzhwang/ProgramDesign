- Ask user to enter a number until the user enters 10 numbers.
- Add each number into an array. 
- Loop through the array and add each number to the sum variable. 
- Divide sum by the size of the array to get the average score.

User input: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Add into array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sum = 55
sum (55) / array size (10) = 5.5

User input: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Add into array: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
sum = 10
sum (10) / array size (10) = 1

- Ask user for dimensions of the roof footprint and store those dimensions in two variables.
- Ask user for number of inches of rainfall and store it in a a variable.
- Convert dimensions to inches and store them in two new variables. 
- Multiply the dimensions (in inches) and the inches of rainfall and store that in a new variable. 
- Divide the results from the previous step by 231 to get the number of gallons of water run off.

User input: 
roofLen = 20
roofWidth = 20
rainfallIn = 1

roofWidthIn = 240
roofLengthIn = 240
rainfallIn = 240 * 240 * 1 = 57600
runOffGallons = 57600/231 = 249.35

User input:
roofLen = 50
roofWidth = 50
rainfallIn = 2

roofWidthIn = 600
roofLengthIn = 600
rainfallIn = 600 * 600 * 2 = 720000
runOffGallons = 720000/231 = 3116.88
